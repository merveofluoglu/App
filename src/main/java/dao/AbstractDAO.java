/**
 * Provides support for the actual implementation of a DAO object.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code AbstractDAO} is designed to achieve the following goals:
 * <ol>
 * <li>a consistent way of accessing the database and managing exceptions is
 * guaranteed for all of the classes that need to directly interact with the
 * DBMS.
 * <li>independence from any particular DBMS is achieved, meaning that the
 * DBMS-dependent code is as isolated as possible and that upper layers can
 * transparently change the underlying DBMS, without the need of modifying their
 * code.
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * With respect to the first goal, {@code AbstractDAO}
 * provides a basic infrastructure which manages the connection, the commitment
 * of transactions (or the roll-back), if needed, and any exception that may be
 * thrown while accessing the database.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * With respect to the second goal,{@code AbstractDAO} is the
 * root of a hierarchy of helper classes, which isolate as much as possible the
 * DBMS-dependent code.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * Concrete subclasses have to implement the abstract method
 * {@link #doAccess()} in order to define the needed
 * logic for accessing the database. This method is, in turn, called by
 * {@link AbstractDAO#access()}, which provides a consistent way of
 * accessing the database and managing exceptions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Concrete sub-classes may also override {@link AbstractDAO#access()}
 * in order to provide a
 * different management of connection and transaction if they have peculiar
 * needs. Nevertheless, the objective of this class is to ease sub-classes by
 * providing a pre-packed logic for connection and transaction management, that
 * is what {@link AbstractDAO#access()} does.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the output parameter returned by the DAO.
