%What are the main functionalities of the web app? what services does it offer and how it is organized?

\hspace{5mm} XXXX is a web application that can only be used by students. Students will be able to register to the system with their "student e-mail addresses (.....@studenti.unipd.it)". This way, some of the user information will be visible, and a secure environment will be provided. In case of possible complaints, the user can be reported to the necessary authorities. This way, fraud can be prevented.

After registering to the web application, users can list their products for sale (paid/free/barter) based on their needs, or they can search for the product they need among the listed items for sale. The pages of the products for sale contain their own descriptions, visuals, and tags. This way, the buyer will have an idea about the product they will purchase. After the purchase, the buyer can leave a review about the seller, and the seller can be introduced to other buyers through their reviews, and they can act accordingly.
