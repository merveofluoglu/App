 \hspace{5mm}The objective of this project is to develop a web application that can help new and existing UniPD members of the University of Padova. The project will ensure that the products that the members need or no longer need are exchanged or sold/bought only among the UniPD members. In this way, it is aimed to ensure reliable and fast shopping, to prevent fraud and being deceived with defective products.
